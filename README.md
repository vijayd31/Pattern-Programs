# Pattern-Programs
Many Interview Questions and Programming Competitions have one such question where we need to write code in order to print a particular design or a pattern.

This repository tries to maintain all such patterns and aims to maintain code for all possible patterns and designs one could think of.

Practicing problems like these helps one understand looping constructs and build logic behind how to print any given pattern or design.
